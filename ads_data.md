I was unable to extract and analyze competitor ad data from digital platforms in Gambia for the roofing sector due to limitations in the available tools.  While I could identify some roofing companies and advertising platforms in Gambia, I could not access or analyze any actual ad creatives, messaging, or placement patterns. More specialized tools, like web scraping tools with ad platform APIs, would be necessary to fulfill the requirements of this task.
